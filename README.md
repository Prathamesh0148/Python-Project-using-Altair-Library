Top 100 Universities: Research Scores and Countries

The first chart represents the distribution of research scores for the top 100 universities, grouped into bins for easier visualization.
The second chart displays the count of universities in the top 100 from each country.
Mean Citations Over the Years by Country

The third set of charts uses faceting to show mean citation scores over the years for different countries. Each country has its own subplot, providing a comparative view of how mean citation scores have evolved over time.
Teaching Score vs. Citation Score for Top Universities

The fourth chart is a scatter plot showing the teaching score on the x-axis, citation score on the y-axis, and the size of the circles representing the number of citations. This chart helps visualize the relationship between teaching and citation scores for the top universities.
Correlation Matrix for Various Scores

The last set of charts is a grid of scatter plots representing the correlation between different scores (quality_of_education, quality_of_faculty, influence, citations, and overall score) for the latest year.
